                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change works.  By contrast,
GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such program, whether
gratis or for fee, you must pass on to recipients same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For developers' and authors' protection, GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of software inside them, although manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with aim of
protecting users' freedom to change software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of GPL to prohibit practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of GPL, as needed to protect freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid special danger that patents applied to free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" work means to copy from or adapt all or part of work
in fashion requiring copyright permission, other than making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called "modified version" of the
earlier work or work "based on" earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either unmodified Program or work based
on Program.

  To "propagate" work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with user through
a computer network, with no transfer of copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to extent that it includes convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells user that there is no warranty for work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view copy of this License.  If
interface presents list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, prominent item in list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for work means preferred form of work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of work.

  A "Standard Interface" means interface that either is official
standard defined by recognized standards body, or, in case of
interfaces specified for particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of executable work include anything, other
than work as whole, that (a) is included in normal form of
packaging Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of work with that
Major Component, or to implement Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of specific operating system
(if any) on which executable work runs, or compiler used to
produce work, or object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for work in object code form means all
source code needed to generate, install, and (for executable
work) run object code and to modify work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
work, and source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for term of
copyright on Program, and are irrevocable provided stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if output, given its
content, constitutes covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of work as means of enforcing, against work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to code;
keep intact all notices of absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients copy of this License along with Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey work based on Program, or modifications to
produce it from Program, in form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license entire work, as whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to whole of work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form larger program,
in or on volume of storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit access or legal rights of compilation's users
beyond what individual works permit.  Inclusion of covered work
in aggregate does not cause this License to apply to other
parts of aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey covered work in object code form under terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey object code in, or embodied in, physical product
    (including physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey object code in, or embodied in, physical product
    (including physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses object code either (1) a
    copy of Corresponding Source for all software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of object code with copy of the
    written offer to provide Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received object code with such offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey object code by offering access from designated
    place (gratis or for charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in same way through same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with object code.  If place to
    copy object code is network server, Corresponding Source
    may be on different server (operated by you or third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where object code and Corresponding
    Source of work are being offered to general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of object code, whose source code is excluded
from Corresponding Source as System Library, need not be
included in conveying object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into dwelling.  In determining whether product is consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For particular
product received by particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of status
of particular user or of way in which particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, product.  A product
is consumer product regardless of whether product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
only significant mode of use of product.

  "Installation Information" for User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that continued functioning of modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, User Product, and conveying occurs as
part of transaction in which right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains ability to install
modified object code on User Product (for example, work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for work that has been modified or installed by recipient, or for
User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when modification itself materially and
adversely affects operation of network or violates rules and
protocols for communication across network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in format that is publicly
documented (and with implementation available to public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to additional permissions.

  When you convey copy of covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to covered work, you may (if authorized by copyright holders of
that material) supplement terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from original version; or

    d) Limiting use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within meaning of section 10.  If Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with term that is further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to covered work material governed by terms
of that license document, provided that further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in relevant source files, statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or notice indicating
where to find applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if copyright
holder fails to notify you of violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after cessation.

  Moreover, your license from particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run copy of Program.  Ancillary propagation of covered work
occurring solely as consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey covered work, recipient automatically
receives license from original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of covered
work results from entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives copy of work also receives whatever
licenses to work party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under previous paragraph, plus right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of work from predecessor in interest, if
predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including cross-claim or counterclaim in lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of Program or work on which Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes right to grant
patent sublicenses in manner consistent with requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate contents of its contributor version.

  In following three paragraphs, "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce patent
(such as express permission to practice patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such patent license to a
party means to make such agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against party.

  If you convey covered work, knowingly relying on patent license,
and Corresponding Source of work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in manner
consistent with requirements of this License, to extend patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for patent license, your conveying the
covered work in country, or your recipient's use of covered work
in country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant patent license to some of parties
receiving covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey specific copy of covered work, then patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
scope of its coverage, prohibits exercise of, or is
conditioned on non-exercise of one or more of rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey covered
work if you are party to arrangement with third party that is
in business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to third party based on extent of your activity of conveying
work, and under which third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive covered work from you, discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
Program, only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying Program.

  13. Use with GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with work licensed
under version 3 of GNU Affero General Public License into single
combined work, and to convey resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to part which is covered work,
but special requirements of GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that certain numbered version of GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by Free Software
Foundation.  If Program does not specify version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by Free Software Foundation.

  If Program specifies that proxy can decide which future
versions of GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of Program in return for fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop new program, and you want it to be of greatest
possible use to public, best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach following notices to program.  It is safest
to attach them to start of each source file to most effectively
state exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
"copyright" line and pointer to where full notice is found.

    <one line to give program's name and brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under terms of GNU General Public License as published by
    Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received copy of GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If program does terminal interaction, make it output short
notice like this when it starts in interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show appropriate
parts of General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for GUI interface, you would use "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as programmer) or school,
if any, to sign "copyright disclaimer" for program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow GNU GPL, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
library.  If this is what you want to do, use GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.
